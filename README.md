# BEA45Wall
An app for storing and creating routes on the Bend Endurance Academy systems wall. Unfortunately the Bend Endurance Academy moved out of the building where this wall is stored, so the app is no longer in use. Go to https://bea45wall.web.app/ to see the finished product and acess all created routes.

This webapp uses firebase to store data.
